      <p className="text-lg">Hello :)</p>
      <p className="mt-4 text-left">
        Hello! I'm a software developer with a strong passion for the frontend
        world, particularly in React and everything related to JavaScript. I
        also have extensive experience in ecommerce development with VTEX and
        backend development with Node.js. I love learning and experimenting with
        new technologies to enhance my skills and knowledge. I'm motivated by
        the challenge of creating intuitive and attractive user interfaces and
        developing robust backend solutions that provide an excellent user
        experience.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4 text-left">
        I've worked on projects of various sizes and complexities, from small
        applications to large enterprise systems. I take pride in being a good
        communicator and team collaborator, always eager to learn from my
        coworkers and contribute in any way I can. My expertise extends to
        developing scalable ecommerce solutions with VTEX and building efficient
        backend systems using Node.js.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4 text-left">
        In my free time, I continue to explore new technologies and stay updated
        with the latest trends by reading blogs and books about software
        development. I also enjoy sports üèÄ and music üéµ. I'm constantly seeking
        new challenges and opportunities to grow both as a developer and as a
        person.
